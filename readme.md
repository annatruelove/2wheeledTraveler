Motorcyclist safety is one of the most important things that a motorcyclist thinks about when he or she is out for a ride. Proper protection and training account for a portion of safe practices, but that is not the full picture. Proper navigation, easily accessible weather, and fuel information are also key pieces of information that is necessary for safe riding. Most navigation and travel mobile applications are targeted towards automobile drivers. As a result, these applications do not meet the criteria that motorcyclists have for relevant information, and ease of use. We are planning on developing a mobile application designed for motorcyclists specifically and will include features that are important for motorcyclists including but not limited to; large easy to use buttons; navigation, fuel gauge, and weather overlay. 

Our client is Jim Mahaney. He is an avid vintage motorcycle rider and works for the Computer Science department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This project is important for the safety and convenience of all motorcyclists on the road today. Our primary objective is to get a working application that can be used and successfully satisfies the criteria of our client.
