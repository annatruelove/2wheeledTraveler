# 2 Wheeled Traveler

Vintage motorcyclists have come to rely on cell phones more and more while riding their motorcycles. This app eliminates the need for multiple apps by combining features like speed, weather, and gas onto a single screen that overlays your standard mapping program.


## Getting started ***

- Prerequisites: what other software needs to be installed before developing or running this software (e.g. Node.js)? Give specific commands to install the software, noting any assumptions about package management tools or operating system.
- Installing: how can a user get a working development environment? Give step-by-step instructions.
- Running locally: once everything is installed, how can a user start a local server?
- Warranty: when (in terms of date or commit) were these instructions last tested and verified to work, by whom, and on what operating system?

## Testing ***

For testing, we created unit tests and generated coverage reports using Jest.
- First,  Jest needs to be installed for Expo
`npm i jest-expo --save-dev`
- To run the tests, run
`npm test`

To view the coverage report, open the `index.html` file withing the `/coverage/` directory. 

## Deployment ***

- Where does the production system live? How would a new developer get access to it?
- Are there any staging or pre-production environments that developers can use?
- What are the various pieces that the fully deployed software uses? For example, with Heroku, what addons does the app use?
- Is continuous integration or continuous deployment enabled? If so, where does it live?


## Technologies used ***

- List which technologies were chosen.
- Mention where in the repository the ADRs live. (Add them to the repository if they're not already there.)

## Contributing ***

- Does a new developer need to get access to any systems (e.g. the GitHub repository, Trello) before he or she is able to contribute?
- Are there any style, testing, or process conventions that a new developer should know about?
- Include a link to your project web site for more background information.

## Authors ***

- Who have the major authors been so far? This is your chance to acknowledge your own efforts.

## License ***

- What license applies to the source code? I recommend a liberal open-source license like the MIT license or the BSD license, so that your client can have the legal right to use and extend your work later in whatever way they would like. (However, teams with an IP agreement with their client should be careful not to pick something without getting their client's approval first.)
