# 2 Wheeled Traveler

Vintage motorcyclists have come to rely on cell phones more and more while riding their motorcycles. This app eliminates the need for multiple apps by combining features like speed, weather, and gas onto a single screen that overlays your standard mapping program.


## Getting started ***

- Prerequisites: what other software needs to be installed before developing or running this software (e.g. Node.js)? Give specific commands to install the software, noting any assumptions about package management tools or operating system.

*need to include react, npm, etc
- Installing: how can a user get a working development environment? Give step-by-step instructions.
- Running locally: once everything is installed, how can a user start a local server?
- Warranty: when (in terms of date or commit) were these instructions last tested and verified to work, by whom, and on what operating system?

## Testing

For testing, we created unit tests and generated coverage reports using Jest.
- First,  Jest needs to be installed for Expo
`npm i jest-expo --save-dev`
- To run the tests, run
`npm test`

To view the coverage report, open the `index.html` file withing the `/coverage/` directory. 

## Deployment ***

- Where does the production system live? How would a new developer get access to it?
- Are there any staging or pre-production environments that developers can use?
- What are the various pieces that the fully deployed software uses? For example, with Heroku, what addons does the app use?
- Is continuous integration or continuous deployment enabled? If so, where does it live?


## Technologies used ***

- List which technologies were chosen.
- Mention where in the repository the ADRs live. (Add them to the repository if they're not already there.)

## Contributing ***

- Does a new developer need to get access to any systems (e.g. the GitHub repository, Trello) before he or she is able to contribute?
- Are there any style, testing, or process conventions that a new developer should know about?
- Include a link to your project web site for more background information.
